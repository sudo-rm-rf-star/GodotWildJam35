# Intro

A huge meteorite crashed into earth 66 million years ago, shattering the earth.
Ancients beings created massive constructs capable of healing earth.
Only a quarter of all life forms survived this impact.

Now, the unthinkable happened again.
A huge space rock came from the sky, breaking our planet.

You are _Cristo Redentor_ the ancient construct tasked with operating the old machines.
Find these machines and mend the earth once again.

# Stonehenge

Ah Stonehenge. You remember hanging out with the druids back in the days.
It is only now you notice the control panel on the back of one of the stones.
Maybe you never saw the panel because you were not looking for it?
An enormous lever draws your attention...

# The Great Pyramids

On the top of the middle pyramid, you see a sundial.
Wait, that is not a normal sundial! It is a large lever.
You wonder whether you should pull it?

# Taj Mahal

You see the great dome of the Taj Mahal and recall siting in its shade enjoying reading an ancient Indian book.
The dome... seems to be able to rotate! Try turning it, maybe it does something.

# Finish

You did it. By using the ancient gravity machines, you fixed the earth!
Now you can return to your resting place, with the knowledge that the planet is saved once again.
Hopefully they will keep it whole for a bit longer now...
